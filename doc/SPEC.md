# pi-supabase-tools

## Problem

Focused Pi sessions should not need unsandboxed Bash merely to operate and verify Supabase. Pi's general shell sandbox blocks capabilities required by local Supabase workflows, while disabling that sandbox grants far more host authority than the session needs.

## Purpose

Provide controlled host execution for Supabase CLI operations and Supabase verification workflows while general shell execution remains disabled or sandboxed.

## Package and tool naming

The package is named `pi-supabase-tools`, reflecting that its leverage does not depend on `pi-sandbox` and that it exposes more than one focused tool.

The model-facing Supabase tool is named `supabase_cli`. This is a breaking replacement for `supabase_bash`; the extension does not register a compatibility alias.

## Supabase CLI scope

The Supabase CLI tool exposes the complete Supabase CLI command interface. It fixes the user-configured executable and command prefix while accepting literal argument arrays, preserving compatibility with existing and future Supabase CLI commands without introducing a second command taxonomy.

The tool does not classify commands as local or remote. A remote mutation can succeed only when the Supabase session's environment and project configuration provide the required authority. Users are responsible for deciding which credentials and remote configuration are available to their sessions.

Existing destructive-operation gating remains a separate safeguard for recognized destructive commands; it is not a comprehensive Supabase CLI authorization policy.

The package has no built-in obsolete-command policy. Users may configure `blockedCommands` as argument-prefix rules with human-readable reasons. A rule matches its contiguous argument sequence even when Supabase global flags precede it. Global and project rules are combined, so project configuration may add restrictions but cannot weaken global restrictions. For example:

```json
{
  "blockedCommands": [
    {
      "prefix": ["db", "diff"],
      "reason": "This project uses PG-Delta declarative sync."
    }
  ]
}
```

A matching command is refused before process execution and reports the configured reason to the Supabase session.

## Toolchain environment

The extension does not install, upgrade, or select tool versions. It loads a user-specified declarative JSON toolchain environment for its child processes, allowing users to make their chosen `npx`, Supabase CLI, and Deno binaries discoverable without relying on interactive login-shell profiles or executing a setup shell script.

Configuration is optional and discovered at Pi's standard scopes:

- global: `~/.pi/agent/supabase-tools.json`
- project: `<cwd>/.pi/supabase-tools.json`

Without either file, defaults are `commands.supabaseCli = ["npx", "supabase"]`, `commands.denoTest = ["deno", "test"]`, `commands.denoCache = ["deno", "cache"]`, `workingDirectory = "supabase"`, `destructiveDbOps = "ask"`, and no Deno test environment profiles.

Global configuration provides defaults. Project configuration overrides scalar values, command prefixes, and environment keys. Project `PATH` additions are prepended ahead of global additions and the effective child `PATH`.

Child processes inherit Pi's environment by default. An `environment` string sets or overrides a variable; `null` explicitly removes an inherited variable. This allows a Supabase session to withhold remote credentials without constructing an entire environment from scratch.

A configuration using the default npm-based Supabase CLI and a Deno binary from `PATH` looks like:

```json
{
  "pathPrepend": ["~/.deno/bin"],
  "environment": {
    "DENO_DIR": "/tmp/deno-cache"
  },
  "commands": {
    "supabaseCli": ["npx", "supabase"],
    "denoTest": ["deno", "test"],
    "denoCache": ["deno", "cache"]
  },
  "workingDirectory": "supabase",
  "destructiveDbOps": "ask",
  "stateFile": ".pi/supabase-tools-state.json",
  "denoTestEnvironmentProfiles": {}
}
```

Command prefixes are argument arrays, never shell strings. `workingDirectory` is resolved relative to the active session's `ctx.cwd` for every invocation and is shared by both tools. A user with a standalone or Homebrew Supabase CLI can replace the npm prefix, for example:

```json
{
  "commands": {
    "supabaseCli": ["/opt/homebrew/bin/supabase"]
  }
}
```

Project configuration is loaded only when Pi reports the project as trusted. This follows Pi's standard project-trust behavior and prevents a globally installed extension from accepting host-execution configuration from an untrusted repository.

Configuration parsing and validation fail closed. If a discovered file is malformed or invalid, the tools remain visible but every invocation reports an actionable configuration error and no child process starts. The extension never silently falls back to defaults past an invalid discovered file.

A missing configured executable produces an actionable error. Version compatibility remains the user's responsibility.

## Destructive-operation gate

The gate's startup mode is configured through `destructiveDbOps` in `supabase-tools.json`; it no longer reads `sandbox.json`. Runtime approvals and pending requests are stored in `.pi/supabase-tools-state.json` by default. The old `supabase-bash-state.json` name is not retained as a compatibility alias.

## Edge Function tests

The extension exposes a separate `deno_test` tool with the fixed `deno test` executable/subcommand interface and literal arguments. It does not expose arbitrary Deno subcommands or shell execution.

Agent-supplied arguments cannot contain Deno permission-increasing flags such as `--allow-*`, `--allow-all`, `--allow-run`, `--allow-scripts`, `-A`, or equivalent short forms. Trusted global or project configuration grants required permissions by including them in the fixed `commands.denoTest` prefix. The default prefix grants no Deno permissions, so a session may select tests and filters but cannot increase its configured authority.

The Supabase CLI tool remains the preferred interface wherever the CLI owns the operation. `deno_test` exists because Supabase CLI 2.111.0 provides database tests but no Edge Function test command, and current Supabase documentation uses Deno's native test runner.

## Deno import/cache preflight

The separate `deno_cache` tool exposes only a user-configured fixed command prefix, defaulting to `deno cache`, with literal model-supplied arguments. Pinning the executable and `cache` subcommand prevents selection of arbitrary Deno subcommands or shell commands while retaining Deno's import specifiers and cache options.

`deno_cache` requires at least one argument and refuses a bare `--`. Agent-supplied Deno permission flags are blocked using the same policy as `deno_test`, including `--allow-import`, `--allow-scripts`, `--allow-run`, `--allow-all`, `-A`, and combined permission short forms. Required permissions may only be placed in the trusted `commands.denoCache` prefix. This is deliberately not a brittle general Deno-option allowlist: options and import targets remain literal arguments to the already-fixed cache subcommand.

The tool uses the shared resolved working directory and declarative child environment. It accepts model-selected integer timeouts from 1 through 300 seconds, defaulting to 120, propagates cancellation, spawns directly with `shell: false`, and retains only the last 50 KiB and 2000 lines of combined output. It does not accept an environment profile.

## Deno test environment profiles

Trusted global or project configuration may define profiles by conservative identifier. Project profiles override global profiles with the same name; otherwise profile maps are combined. Each profile has the fixed `supabaseStatus` source and at least one source-to-target environment variable mapping:

```json
{
  "denoTestEnvironmentProfiles": {
    "local-served": {
      "source": "supabaseStatus",
      "variables": {
        "API_URL": "SUPABASE_URL",
        "ANON_KEY": "SUPABASE_ANON_KEY",
        "SERVICE_ROLE_KEY": "SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

`deno_test` optionally accepts `environmentProfile: "local-served"`. Omitting it preserves the ordinary configured environment. The tool interface never accepts environment objects or values, and an unknown profile fails before a child process starts.

For a selected profile, the extension privately runs the configured Supabase CLI prefix with only the fixed internal arguments `status -o env`. Effective `blockedCommands` rules apply to this internal operation before execution. It uses the normal resolved working directory and base child environment, a fixed 30-second timeout, and a 64 KiB limit on each output stream. Timeout and cancellation terminate the acquisition process group where the platform supports it and use a bounded settlement fallback rather than waiting indefinitely for inherited stdio. Only strict environment assignments from stdout are decoded as data; no output is evaluated as shell syntax, and values containing NUL are rejected before process launch. The configured source variables are mapped onto the Deno test environment. Unmapped acquired variables are not injected.

Acquisition output is never streamed or included in failures. Errors expose only the acquisition phase, timeout or exit status where applicable, and configured variable names needed to correct missing mappings. Test output for a profile-backed invocation is withheld until completion and every exact repetition of a non-empty injected value is replaced with `[REDACTED]`, including unsuccessful subprocess output. Longer values are replaced first.

This redaction protects against accidental direct repetition. Test code receives the injected values and can deliberately transform, split, hash, or encode them; exact-value redaction is not a sandbox or a defense against intentional exfiltration. Profiles should therefore map only values the selected tests are trusted to receive, and Deno permissions should remain least-privileged.

## SQL execution

The initial scope does not expose `psql`. Supabase sessions execute local SQL through `supabase db query --local`, keeping SQL access behind the Supabase CLI tool. This behavior was verified against Supabase CLI 2.111.0 and a running local Supabase stack.

Each invocation passes SQL as one literal argument and accepts one top-level PostgreSQL prepared statement. Invocations use separate CLI processes and database connections, so transaction state, temporary objects, session settings, and advisory locks do not persist between calls. Multi-operation reversible smoke checks must use one `DO` statement and explicitly clean up.

## Edge Functions service lifecycle

The extension registers `supabase_functions_serve({ action: "start" | "status" | "stop" })`. It accepts no model-provided process, command, environment, path, timeout, PID, signal, port, probe, or log controls.

Start is disabled unless effective trusted configuration contains `functionsServe: { args: string[] }`; an empty array is valid. The project object replaces the global object as a whole. Start requires `ctx.isProjectTrusted()`. It directly spawns the configured `commands.supabaseCli` prefix followed by `functions`, `serve`, and the trusted arguments, with `shell: false`, the shared resolved working directory, and shared child environment. Effective `blockedCommands` rules apply to that logical argument list. The extension never creates, reads, changes, or removes environment files.

One in-memory manager owns one controller per project for the current Pi session. A controller is exclusive for its project: this package does not support multiple concurrently managed `functions serve` instances for the same project. It performs no external adoption, process or port discovery, PID file, lock, lease, daemon, or cross-session coordination. State is serialized through `stopped`, `starting`, `running`, and `stopping`. Repeated start while running and stop while stopped are idempotent. Unexpected exit returns the controller to stopped and records only timestamp, exit code, and signal. Stop and status use captured live state even if configuration later changes or becomes malformed.

Startup uses a supervised long-lived process and the fixed 120-second timeout. Both output streams are drained before readiness waiting. Readiness requires Supabase's `Serving functions on ...` marker, tolerating ANSI, timestamps, UTF-8, and chunk boundaries. The marker is emitted by the embedded `Deno.serve` listener in Supabase CLI 2.111.0; it establishes listener startup, not the health of any function. There is no HTTP probe. Marker changes cause timeout and fail closed. Early exit, spawn error, abort, shutdown during start, or timeout terminates the owned process group and settles boundedly.

Stop sends SIGTERM to the owned process group and allows a bounded 10-second grace for Supabase CLI 2.111.0's Bun/TypeScript path to remove the Edge Runtime container and staged secret artifacts. It uses SIGKILL only if the grace expires, then bounds stdio settlement. A forced stop records `cleanup_unconfirmed`; it never claims confirmed cleanup. Existing one-shot timeout and abort behavior remains immediate hard process-tree termination. Normal quit, reload, new, resume, and fork invokes idempotent cleanup. Recovery from SIGKILL, host failure, or power loss is out of scope.

Service output remains private and is never sent through tool updates, results, errors, details, session lifecycle state, or persisted entries. Results contain only canned phase text plus structured phase, timestamps, exit code/signal, and cleanup confirmation. The tool narrows model choice but is not an operating-system sandbox.

## Session steering

The package does not prescribe orchestration or automatically load a role prompt. Users grant `supabase_cli` and `deno_test` to a visible, named Supabase session through Pi's tool allowlist and own any additional steering.

The package includes `examples/supabase-session-prompt.md` as an optional, non-loaded steering example.

## First usable slice

The initial delivery uses platform-neutral direct process spawning and is verified against the maintainer's macOS setup. Linux and WSL2 verification are deferred; the implementation must avoid unnecessary macOS-specific assumptions.

## Security posture

The module reduces host execution authority from arbitrary shell commands to Supabase CLI operations. It uses direct process spawning without shell parsing, so arguments remain literal and cannot introduce additional shell commands.

This is a narrower interface than unsandboxed Bash, not an operating-system sandbox around the Supabase CLI or Deno processes. The tools and their descendants run with the host permissions and environment explicitly granted to the Pi process. On timeout or cancellation, the shared runner terminates the process group where supported and uses a bounded settlement fallback for descendant-held stdio. Combined subprocess output retained by the runner is bounded to its last 50 KiB and 2000 lines; truncation is marked in returned output.
